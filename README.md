======

TheCheatNet is a plugin developed by [Rambolo](https://github.com/Rambolo) to stop every single kind of mod/cheat/hack that will give the player an unfair advantage over all of the other players on the server. This plugin will ensure that every player will have to use a "non-vanilla" client (this does not include any perfomance enhancing mods, e.g. Optifine).

Installation
------
* Get craftbukkit off of [Bukkit's wiki page](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server).
* Download TheCheatNet off of the Bukkit website (I will add the link upon posting on Bukkit).
* Locate TheCheatNet and put it inside of your 'plugins' folder.
* After you have finished all of that, restart your server.
